		  <h3>Get Started!</h3>    	  
    	  <p>
    	  		To get started using MagRocket, you should create a Publication that corresponds to your iOS Baker Newsstand application.  After you create the Publication, you can add Issues.
				 <ul>
			    <li><a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>index.php/admin/scrud/browse?table=PUBLICATION">Create/Edit Publications</a></li>
			    <li><a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>index.php/admin/scrud/browse?table=ISSUES">Create/Edit Issues</a></li>		    			    			    			    			    			    			    
			    </ul>   
    	  </p>
    	  <p>
    	  		To manage your Publications and Issues, use the <strong>Publication Management</strong> dropdown menu.  To view/manage the backend MagRocket data, use the <strong>Data Browser</strong> dropdown menu, both located at the top of this page.
